Shared UI package for OpenWork frontend shells.

This folder exposes simple React components (Header, Footer, Banner, LoginCard) and a shared stylesheet `shared.css`.

Usage (in a thin shell):
- Import components: `import { Header, Footer } from '@openwork/shared-ui'`
- Include `@openwork/shared-ui/src/shared.css` in your entry if needed.

Note: This package is a lightweight copy of common UI for quick scaffolding. For production prefer publishing or creating a proper monorepo setup.
